A userscript to mark positions on a page and to scroll to them.

Usage
    - Change keyMark variable. Control + this key to save a position.
    - Change keyGoto variable. Control + this key to scroll to a position.
      (Test to see what keycodes your system(browser, keyboard layout) emits,
      follow this link:
        https://jsbin.com/xugewaqoza/edit?html,js,output
      Replace the numbers in variables by the keycode number.)
    - Change timeDeltaIndex. Time window you have to press a number where you
      want to save a position or to scroll to position.
    - To save a position, press control + keyMark key and then a number.
    - To scroll to a previously marked position, press control + keyGoto key
      and then a number.

Supported Browser
    I have tested the script works on:
        - Firefox
        - Chromium

Todo
    - Change this to a Web Extension.
    - Because of the above, settings are easier to do, so make them
      configurable.
    - Just save positions to a limited length LIFO and ditch the numbers
      altogether? A one or two positions marked is probably most common and
      it's easier to use.
